# raspi-ros-client

ROS client for setting the Raspberry GPIO configuration with the raspi_ros Tool Manager (https://github.com/ReconCycle/raspi_ros/tree/main). When the client is started, it opens a terminal window that guides you through the configuration.

```sh
rosrun raspi_ros_client terminal_client.py
```
